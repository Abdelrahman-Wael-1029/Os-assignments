can you write this program in java (take care of the print messages scenario (such as randomness and "arrived and waiting" message)) using given semaphore class:

"Problem Definition:
It is required to simulate a limited number of devices connected to a routerâ€™s Wi-Fi
using Java threading and semaphore. Routers can be designed to limit the number of
open connections. For example, a Router may wish to have only N connections at any
point in time. As soon as N connections are made, the Router will not accept other
incoming connections until an existing connection is released. Explain how
semaphores can be used by a Router to limit the number of concurrent connections.
Following rules should be applied:
. The Wi-Fi number of connected devices is initially empty.
. If a client is logged in (print a message that a client has logged in) and if it can
be served (means that it can reach the internet), then the client should
perform the following activities:
. Connect
. Perform online activity
. Log out
Note: these actions will be represented by printed messages, such that there is a
random waiting time between the printed messages when a client connects, do
some online activities and logged out.

. If a client arrives and all connections are occupied, it must wait until one of
the currently available clients finish his service and leave.
. After a client finishes his service, he leave and one of the waiting clients (if
exist) will connect to the internet.
Solution Design:
Your program must contain the following classes:
1. Router Class: This class contains a list of connections and methods to occupy a
connection and release a connection.
2. Semaphore Class:
class semaphore {
    protected int value = 0 ;
    protected semaphore() { value = 0 ; }
    protected semaphore(int initial) { value = initial ; }
    public synchronized void P() {
    
    value-- ;
    if (value < 0)
    try { wait() ; } catch( InterruptedException e ) { }
    }
    public synchronized void V() {
    value++ ; if (value <= 0) notify() ;
    }
   }
3. Device Class: Represent different devices (threads) that can be connected to the
router;
Each device has its own name (i.e. C1) and type (i.e. mobile, pc, tablet...) and it may
perform three activities: connect, perform online activity and disconnect/logout.
4. Network Class: This class contains the main method in which the user is asked
for two inputs:
. N: max number of connections a router can accept
. TC: total number of devices that wish to connect).
. TC lines that contain: Name of each device, and its Type.
Program Output:
You will print the output logs in a file, which simulates the execution order of the
devices threads and the printed messages of each device.
NOTE THAT: This is just an example not the only scenario that can be applied.
Sample Input:
What is the number of WI-FI Connections?
2
What is the number of devices Clients want to connect?
4
C1 mobile
C2 tablet
C3 pc
C4 pc
Sample Output:
- (C1)(mobile)arrived
- (C2)(tablet)arrived
- Connection 1: C1 Occupied
- Connection 2: C2 Occupied
- C4(pc) arrived and waiting
- C3(pc)arrived and waiting
- Connection 1: C1 login
- Connection 1: C1 performs online activity
- Connection 2: C2 login
- Connection 2: C2 performs online activity
- Connection 1: C1 Logged out
- Connection 1: C4 Occupied
- Connection 1: C4 log in
- Connection 1: C4 performs online activity
- Connection 2: C2 Logged out
- Connection 2: C3 Occupied
